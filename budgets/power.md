# Power Budget

9v Alkaline = 565 mAh  
1.5v AA Alkaline = 2200 mAh

From digikey:  
```
Battery Life = Battery Capacity in mA per hour / Load Current in mA * 0.70
```

From somewhere else:  
```
Average current = (10mA \* 0.5s + 16uA \* 10s) / 10.5s = 0.49mA
Battery time = 450mAh/0.49mA = 918 hrs = at least 38 days
```
