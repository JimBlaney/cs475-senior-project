29 bytes/observation * 1440 observations/day = 41760 bytes / day

1GB = 1073741824 bytes รท 41760 bytes/day ~= ~25k days (~70 years)

### Power Budget

9v Alkaline = 565 mAh
1.5v AA Alkaline = 2200 mAh

From digikey:
```
Battery Life = Battery Capacity in mA per hour / Load Current in mA * 0.70
```

Test start: 1029


From somewhere else:
```
Average current = (10mA \* 0.5s + 16uA \* 10s) / 10.5s = 0.49mA
Battery time = 450mAh/0.49mA = 918 hrs = at least 38 days
```
